## Qubit

A [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) represents a quantum bit which is the basic unit of computation.

It can be created initially with a 0 or 1 state.

A qubit when passed through hadmard gates will be put into a superposition.

When `show` method is called on a qubit, it collapses into a either 0 or 1 based on its internal probability distribution.
